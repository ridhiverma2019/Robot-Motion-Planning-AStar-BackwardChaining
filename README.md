# Robot-Motion-Planning-AStar-BackwardChaining
This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to robot motion planning by integrating the A* algorithm with backward chaining. 
It is designed to efficiently navigate complex environments by improving decision-making and adaptability.

## Features
- Pathfinding using the A* algorithm
- Enhanced goal-oriented reasoning with backward chaining
- Dynamic obstacle handling
- Visualization of robot paths in a grid-based environment
